# Amazon EKS Kubernetes versions<a name="kubernetes-versions"></a>

The Kubernetes project is continually integrating new features, design updates, and bug fixes\. The community releases new Kubernetes minor versions, such as `1.27`\. New version updates are available on average every three months\. Each minor version is supported for approximately twelve months after it's first released\. 

## Available Amazon EKS Kubernetes versions<a name="available-versions"></a>

The following Kubernetes versions are currently available for new Amazon EKS clusters:
+ `1.27`
+ `1.26`
+ `1.25`
+ `1.24`
+ `1.23`

If your application doesn't require a specific version of Kubernetes, we recommend that you use the latest available Kubernetes version that's supported by Amazon EKS for your clusters\. As new Kubernetes versions become available in Amazon EKS, we recommend that you proactively update your clusters to use the latest available version\. For instructions on how to update your cluster, see [Updating an Amazon EKS cluster Kubernetes version](update-cluster.md)\. For more information about Kubernetes releases, see [Amazon EKS Kubernetes release calendar](#kubernetes-release-calendar) and [Amazon EKS version support and FAQ](#version-deprecation)\.

**Note**  
For `1.24` and later clusters, officially published Amazon EKS AMIs include `containerd` as the only runtime\. Kubernetes versions earlier than `1.24` use Docker as the default runtime\. These versions have a bootstrap flag option that you can use to test out your workloads on any supported cluster with `containerd`\. For more information, see [Amazon EKS ended support for `Dockershim`](dockershim-deprecation.md)\.

## Kubernetes 1\.27<a name="kubernetes-1.27"></a>

Kubernetes `1.27` is now available in Amazon EKS\. For more information about Kubernetes `1.27`, see the [official release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/11/kubernetes-v1-27-release/)\.

**Important**  
The support for the alpha `seccomp` annotations `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod` and `container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io` annotations was removed\. The alpha `seccomp` annotations was deprecated in `1.19`, and with their removal in `1.27`, `seccomp` fields will no longer auto\-populate for `Pods` with `seccomp` annotations\. Instead, use the `securityContext.seccompProfile` field for `Pods` or containers to configure `seccomp` profiles\. To check whether you are using the deprecated alpha `seccomp` annotations in your cluster, run the following command:  

  ```
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json | grep -E 'seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod|container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io'
  ```
The `--container-runtime` command line argument for the `kubelet` was removed\. The default container runtime for Amazon EKS has been containerd since `1.24`, which eliminates the need to specify the container runtime\. From `1.27` onwards, Amazon EKS will ignore the `--container-runtime` argument passed to any bootstrap scripts\. It is important that you don't pass this argument to `--kubelet-extra-args` in order to prevent errors during the node bootstrap process\. You must remove the `--container-runtime` argument from all of your node creation workflows and build scripts\.
+ The `kubelet` in Kubernetes `1.27` increased the default `kubeAPIQPS` to `50` and `kubeAPIBurst` to `100`\. These enhancements allow the `kubelet` to handle a higher volume of API queries, improving response times and performance\. When the demands for `Pods` increase, due to scaling requirements, the revised defaults ensure that the `kubelet` can efficiently manage the increased workload\. As a result, `Pod` launches are quicker and cluster operations are more effective\.
+ You can use more fine grained `Pod` topology to spread policies such as `minDomain`\. This parameter gives you the ability to specify the minimum number of domains your `Pods` should be spread across\. `nodeAffinityPolicy` and `nodeTaintPolicy` allow for an extra level of granularity in governing `Pod` distribution\. This is in accordance to node affinities, taints, and the `matchLabelKeys` field in the `topologySpreadConstraints` of your `Pod's` specification\. This permits the selection of `Pods` for spreading calculations following a rolling upgrade\.
+ Kubernetes`1.27` promoted to beta a new policy mechanism for `StatefulSets` that controls the lifetime of their `PersistentVolumeClaims`\(`PVCs`\)\. The new `PVC` retention policy lets you specify if the `PVCs` generated from the `StatefulSet` spec template will be automatically deleted or retained when the `StatefulSet` is deleted or replicas in the `StatefulSet` are scaled down\.
+ The [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) option in the Kubernetes API server helps prevent `HTTP/2` client connections from being stuck on a single API server instance, by randomly closing a connection\. When the connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect, and will likely land on a different API server as a result of load balancing\. Amazon EKS version `1.27` has enabled `goaway-chance` flag\. If your workload running on Amazon EKS cluster uses a client that is not compatible with [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8), we recommend that you update your client to handle `GOAWAY` by reconnecting on connection termination\.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.27` changelog, see [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md)\.

## Kubernetes 1\.26<a name="kubernetes-1.26"></a>

Kubernetes `1.26` is now available in Amazon EKS\. For more information about Kubernetes `1.26`, see the [official release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/12/09/kubernetes-v1-26-release/)\.

**Important**  
Kubernetes `1.26` no longer supports CRI `v1alpha2`\. This results in the `kubelet` no longer registering the node if the container runtime doesn't support CRI `v1`\. This also means that Kubernetes `1.26` doesn't support containerd minor version `1.5` and earlier\. If you're using containerd, you need to upgrade to containerd version `1.6.0` or later before you upgrade any nodes to Kubernetes `1.26`\. You also need to upgrade any other container runtimes that only support the `v1alpha2`\. For more information, defer to the container runtime vendor\. By default, Amazon Linux and Bottlerocket AMIs include containerd version `1.6.6`\.
+ Before you upgrade to Kubernetes `1.26`, upgrade your Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes to version `1.12` or later\. If you don't upgrade to Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes version `1.12` or later, the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes will crash\. For more information, see [Working with the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes for Kubernetes Amazon EKS add\-on](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-vpc-cni.html)\.
+ The [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) option in the Kubernetes API server helps prevent `HTTP/2` client connections from being stuck on a single API server instance, by randomly closing a connection\. When the connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect, and will likely land on a different API server as a result of load balancing\. Amazon EKS version `1.26` has enabled `goaway-chance` flag\. If your workload running on Amazon EKS cluster uses a client that is not compatible with [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8), we recommend that you update your client to handle `GOAWAY` by reconnecting on connection termination\.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.26` changelog, see [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.26.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.26.md)\.

## Kubernetes 1\.25<a name="kubernetes-1.25"></a>

Kubernetes `1.25` is now available in Amazon EKS\. For more information about Kubernetes `1.25`, see the [official release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/23/kubernetes-v1-25-release/)\.

**Important**  
`PodSecurityPolicy` \(PSP\) is removed in Kubernetes `1.25`\. PSPs are replaced with [Pod Security Admission \(PSA\)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) and Pod Security Standards \(PSS\)\. PSA is a built\-in admission controller that implements the security controls outlined in the [PSS ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/)\. PSA and PSS are graduated to stable in Kubernetes `1.25` and are enabled in Amazon EKS by default\. If you have PSPs in your cluster, make sure to migrate from PSP to the built\-in Kubernetes PSS or to a policy\-as\-code solution before upgrading your cluster to version `1.25`\. If you don't migrate from PSP, you might encounter interruptions to your workloads\. For more information, see the [Pod security policy \(PSP\) removal FAQ](pod-security-policy-removal-faq.md)\. 
Kubernetes version `1.25` contains changes that alter the behavior of an existing feature known as API Priority and Fairness \(APF\)\. APF serves to shield the API server from potential overload during periods of heightened request volumes\. It does this by placing restrictions on the number of concurrent requests that can be processed at any given time\. This is achieved through the application of distinct priority levels and limits to requests originating from various workloads or users\. This approach ensures that critical applications or high\-priority requests receive preferential treatment, while simultaneously preventing lower priority requests from overwhelming the API server\. For more information, see [API Priority and Fairness](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/) in the Kubernetes documentation or [API Priority and Fairness](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/scalability/docs/control-plane/#api-priority-and-fairness) in the EKS Best Practices Guide\.  
These updates were introduced in [PR \#10352](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103521) and [PR \#118601](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/118601)\. Previously, APF treated all types of requests uniformly, with each request consuming a single unit of the concurrent request limit\. The APF behavior change assigns higher units of concurrency to `LIST` requests due to the exceptionally heavy burden put on the API server by these requests\. The API server estimates the number of objects that will be returned by a `LIST` request\. It assigns a unit of concurrency that is proportional to the number of objects returned\.  
Upon upgrading to Amazon EKS version `1.25` or higher, this updated behavior might cause workloads with heavy `LIST` requests \(that previously functioned without issue\) to encounter rate limiting\. This would be indicated by an HTTP 429 response code\. To avoid potential workload disruption due to `LIST` requests being rate limited, we strongly encourage you to restructure your workloads to reduce the rate of these requests\. Alternatively, you can address this issue by adjusting the APF settings to allocate more capacity for essential requests while reducing the capacity allocated to non\-essential ones\. For more information about these mitigation techniques, see [Preventing Dropped Requests](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/scalability/docs/control-plane/#preventing-dropped-requests) in the EKS Best Practices Guide\. 
Amazon EKS `1.25` includes enhancements to cluster authentication that contain updated YAML libraries\. If a YAML value in the `aws-auth` `ConfigMap` found in the `kube-system` namespace starts with a macro, where the first character is a curly brace, you should add quotation marks \(`“ ”`\) before and after the curly braces \(`{ }`\)\. This is required to ensure that `aws-iam-authenticator` version `v0.6.3` accurately parses the `aws-auth` `ConfigMap` in Amazon EKS `1.25`\.
The beta API version \(`discovery.k8s.io/v1beta1`\) of `EndpointSlice` was deprecated in Kubernetes `1.21` and is no longer served as of Kubernetes `1.25`\. This API has been updated to `discovery.k8s.io/v1`\. For more information, see [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#endpointslice-v125](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#endpointslice-v125) in the Kubernetes documentation\. The AWS Load Balancer Controller `v2.4.6` and earlier used the `v1beta1` endpoint to communicate with `EndpointSlices`\. If you're using the `EndpointSlices` configuration for the AWS Load Balancer Controller, you must upgrade to AWS Load Balancer Controller `v2.4.7` *before* upgrading your Amazon EKS cluster to `1.25`\. If you upgrade to `1.25` while using the `EndpointSlices` configuration for the AWS Load Balancer Controller, the controller will crash and result in interruptions to your workloads\. To upgrade the controller, see [Installing the AWS Load Balancer Controller add\-on](aws-load-balancer-controller.md)\.
+ `SeccompDefault` is promoted to beta in Kubernetes `1.25`\. By setting the `--seccomp-default` flag when you configure `kubelet`, the container runtime uses its `RuntimeDefault``seccomp` profile, rather than the unconfined \(`seccomp disabled`\) mode\. The default profiles provide a strong set of security defaults, while preserving the functionality of the workload\. Although this flag is available, Amazon EKS doesn't enable this flag by default, so Amazon EKS behavior is effectively unchanged\. If you want to, you can start enabling this on your nodes\. For more details, see the tutorial [Restrict a Container's Syscalls with seccomp](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/#enable-the-use-of-runtimedefault-as-the-default-seccomp-profile-for-all-workloads/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.
+ Support for the Container Runtime Interface \(CRI\) for Docker \(also known as `Dockershim`\) was removed from Kubernetes `1.24` and later\. The only container runtime in Amazon EKS official AMIs for Kubernetes `1.24` and later clusters is `containerd`\. Before upgrading to Amazon EKS `1.24` or later, remove any reference to bootstrap script flags that aren't supported anymore\. For more information, see [Amazon EKS ended support for `Dockershim`](dockershim-deprecation.md)\.
+ The support for wildcard queries was deprecated in CoreDNS `1.8.7` and removed in CoreDNS `1.9`\. This was done as a security measure\. Wildcard queries no longer work and return `NXDOMAIN` instead of an IP address\.
+ The [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) option in the Kubernetes API server helps prevent `HTTP/2` client connections from being stuck on a single API server instance, by randomly closing a connection\. When the connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect, and will likely land on a different API server as a result of load balancing\. Amazon EKS version `1.25` has enabled `goaway-chance` flag\. If your workload running on Amazon EKS cluster uses a client that is not compatible with [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8), we recommend that you update your client to handle `GOAWAY` by reconnecting on connection termination\.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.25` changelog, see [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md#changelog-since-v1240](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md#changelog-since-v1240)\.

## Kubernetes 1\.24<a name="kubernetes-1.24"></a>

Kubernetes `1.24` is now available in Amazon EKS\. For more information about Kubernetes `1.24`, see the [official release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/05/03/kubernetes-1-24-release-announcement/)\.

**Important**  
Starting with Kubernetes `1.24`, new beta APIs aren't enabled in clusters by default\. By default, existing beta APIs and new versions of existing beta APIs continue to be enabled\. Amazon EKS follows the same behavior as upstream Kubernetes `1.24`\. The feature gates that control new features for both new and existing API operations are enabled by default\. This is in alignment with upstream Kubernetes\. For more information, see [KEP\-3136: Beta APIs Are Off by Default](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-architecture/3136-beta-apis-off-by-default/README.md) on GitHub\.
Support for Container Runtime Interface \(CRI\) for Docker \(also known as Dockershim\) is removed from Kubernetes `1.24`\. Amazon EKS official AMIs have containerd as the only runtime\. Before moving to Amazon EKS `1.24` or higher, you must remove any reference to bootstrap script flags that aren't supported anymore\. You must also make sure that IP forwarding is enabled for your worker nodes\. For more information, see [Amazon EKS ended support for `Dockershim`](dockershim-deprecation.md)\.
If you already have Fluentd configured for Container Insights, then you must migrate Fluentd to Fluent Bit before updating your cluster\. The Fluentd parsers are configured to only parse log messages in JSON format\. Unlike `dockerd`, the `containerd` container runtime has log messages that aren't in JSON format\. If you don't migrate to Fluent Bit, some of the configured Fluentd's parsers will generate a massive amount of errors inside the Fluentd container\. For more information on migrating, see [Set up Fluent Bit as a DaemonSet to send logs to CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-setup-logs-FluentBit.html)\.
In Kubernetes `1.23` and earlier, `kubelet` serving certificates with unverifiable IP and DNS Subject Alternative Names \(SANs\) are automatically issued with unverifiable SANs\. These unverifiable SANs are omitted from the provisioned certificate\. In version `1.24` and later clusters, `kubelet` serving certificates aren't issued if any SAN can't be verified\. This prevents `kubectl` exec and `kubectl` logs commands from working\. For more information, see [Certificate signing considerations before upgrading your cluster to Kubernetes 1\.24](cert-signing.md#csr-considerations)\.
When upgrading an Amazon EKS `1.23` cluster that uses Fluent Bit, you must make sure that it's running `k8s/1.3.12` or later\. You can do this by reapplying the latest applicable Fluent Bit YAML file from GitHub\. For more information, see [Setting up Fluent Bit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-setup-logs-FluentBit.html#Container-Insights-FluentBit-setup) in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide\.
+ You can use Topology Aware Hints to indicate your preference for keeping traffic in zone when cluster worker nodes are deployed across multiple availability zones\. Routing traffic within a zone can help reduce costs and improve network performance\. By default, Topology Aware Hints are enabled in Amazon EKS `1.24`\. For more information, see [Topology Aware Hints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/topology-aware-hints/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.
+ The `PodSecurityPolicy` \(PSP\) is scheduled for removal in Kubernetes `1.25`\. PSPs are being replaced with [Pod Security Admission \(PSA\)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/)\. PSA is a built\-in admission controller that uses the security controls that are outlined in the [Pod Security Standards \(PSS\) ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/)\. PSA and PSS are both beta features and are enabled in Amazon EKS by default\. To address the removal of PSP in version `1.25`, we recommend that you implement PSS in Amazon EKS\. For more information, see [Implementing Pod Security Standards in Amazon EKS](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/implementing-pod-security-standards-in-amazon-eks/) on the AWS blog\.
+ The `client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1` ExecCredential is removed in Kubernetes `1.24`\. The ExecCredential API was generally available in Kubernetes `1.22`\. If you use a client\-go credential plugin that relies on the `v1alpha1` API, contact the distributor of your plugin on how to migrate to the `v1` API\.
+ For Kubernetes `1.24`, we contributed a feature to the upstream Cluster Autoscaler project that simplifies scaling Amazon EKS managed node groups to and from zero nodes\. Previously, for the Cluster Autoscaler to understand the resources, labels, and taints of a managed node group that was scaled to zero nodes, you needed to tag the underlying Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with the details of the nodes that it was responsible for\. Now, when there are no running nodes in the managed node group, the Cluster Autoscaler calls the Amazon EKS `DescribeNodegroup` API operation\. This API operation provides the information that the Cluster Autoscaler requires of the managed node group's resources, labels, and taints\. This feature requires that you add the `eks:DescribeNodegroup` permission to the Cluster Autoscaler service account IAM policy\. When the value of a Cluster Autoscaler tag on the Auto Scaling group powering an Amazon EKS managed node group conflicts with the node group itself, the Cluster Autoscaler prefers the value of the Auto Scaling group tag\. This is so that you can override values as needed\. For more information, see [Autoscaling](autoscaling.md)\.
+ If you intend to use Inferentia or Trainium instance types with Amazon EKS `1.24`, you must upgrade to the AWS Neuron device plugin version 1\.9\.3\.0 or later\. For more information, see [Neuron K8 release \[1\.9\.3\.0\]](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/release-notes/containers/neuron-k8.html#id46) in the AWS Neuron Documentation\.
+ `Containerd` has `IPv6` enabled for Pods, by default\. It applies node kernel settings to Pod network namespaces\. Because of this, containers in a Pod bind to both `IPv4` \(`127.0.0.1`\) and `IPv6` \(`::1`\) loopback addresses\. `IPv6` is the default protocol for communication\. Before updating your cluster to version `1.24`, we recommend that you test your multi\-container Pods\. Modify apps so that they can bind to all IP addresses on loopback interfaces\. The majority of libraries enable `IPv6` binding, which is backward compatible with `IPv4`\. When it’s not possible to modify your application code, you have two options:
  + Run an `init` container and set `disable ipv6` to `true` \(`sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable ipv6=1`\)\.
  + Configure a [mutating admission webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook) to inject an `init` container alongside your application Pods\.

  If you need to block `IPv6` for all Pods across all nodes, you might have to disable `IPv6` on your instances\.
+ The [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) option in the Kubernetes API server helps prevent `HTTP/2` client connections from being stuck on a single API server instance, by randomly closing a connection\. When the connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect, and will likely land on a different API server as a result of load balancing\. Amazon EKS version `1.24` has enabled `goaway-chance` flag\. If your workload running on Amazon EKS cluster uses a client that is not compatible with [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8), we recommend that you update your client to handle `GOAWAY` by reconnecting on connection termination\.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.24` changelog, see [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#changelog-since-v1230](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#changelog-since-v1230)\.

## Kubernetes 1\.23<a name="kubernetes-1.23"></a>

Kubernetes `1.23` is now available in Amazon EKS\. For more information about Kubernetes `1.23`, see the [official release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/12/07/kubernetes-1-23-release-announcement/)\.

**Important**  
The Kubernetes in\-tree to container storage interface \(CSI\) volume migration feature is enabled\. This feature enables the replacement of existing Kubernetes in\-tree storage plugins for Amazon EBS with a corresponding Amazon EBS CSI driver\. For more information, see [Kubernetes 1\.17 Feature: Kubernetes In\-Tree to CSI Volume Migration Moves to Beta](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/12/09/kubernetes-1-17-feature-csi-migration-beta/) on the Kubernetes blog\.  
The feature translates in\-tree APIs to equivalent CSI APIs and delegates operations to a replacement CSI driver\. With this feature, if you use existing `StorageClass`, `PersistentVolume`, and `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects that belong to these workloads, there likely won't be any noticeable change\. The feature enables Kubernetes to delegate all storage management operations from the in\-tree plugin to the CSI driver\. If you use Amazon EBS volumes in an existing cluster, install the Amazon EBS CSI driver in your cluster before you update your cluster to version `1.23`\. If you don't install the driver before updating an existing cluster, interruptions to your workloads might occur\. If you plan to deploy workloads that use Amazon EBS volumes in a new `1.23` cluster, install the Amazon EBS CSI driver in your cluster before deploying the workloads your cluster\. For instructions on how to install the Amazon EBS CSI driver on your cluster, see [Amazon EBS CSI driver](ebs-csi.md)\. For frequently asked questions about the migration feature, see [Amazon EBS CSI migration frequently asked questions](ebs-csi-migration-faq.md)\.
+ Kubernetes stopped supporting `dockershim` in version `1.20` and removed `dockershim` in version `1.24`\. For more information, see [Kubernetes is Moving on From Dockershim: Commitments and Next Steps](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/01/07/kubernetes-is-moving-on-from-dockershim/) in the Kubernetes blog\. Amazon EKS will end support for `dockershim` starting in Amazon EKS version `1.24`\. Starting with Amazon EKS version `1.24`, Amazon EKS official AMIs will have `containerd` as the only runtime\.

  Even though Amazon EKS version `1.23` continues to support `dockershim`, we recommend that you start testing your applications now to identify and remove any Docker dependencies\. This way, you are prepared to update your cluster to version `1.24`\. For more information about `dockershim` removal, see [Amazon EKS ended support for `Dockershim`](dockershim-deprecation.md)\.
+ Kubernetes graduated `IPv4`/`IPv6` dual\-stack networking for Pods, services, and nodes to general availability\. However, Amazon EKS and the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes don't support dual\-stack networking\. Your clusters can assign `IPv4` or `IPv6` addresses to Pods and services, but can't assign both address types\.
+ Kubernetes graduated the Pod Security Admission \(PSA\) feature to beta\. The feature is enabled by default\. For more information, see [Pod Security Admission](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) in the Kubernetes documentation\. PSA replaces the [Pod Security Policy](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/pods/#pod-security-solutions) \(PSP\) admission controller\. The PSP admission controller isn't supported and is scheduled for removal in Kubernetes version `1.25`\.

  The PSP admission controller enforces Pod security standards on Pods in a namespace based on specific namespace labels that set the enforcement level\. For more information, see [Pod Security Standards \(PSS\) and Pod Security Admission \(PSA\)](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/pods/#pod-security-standards-pss-and-pod-security-admission-psa) in the Amazon EKS best practices guide\.
+ The `kube-proxy` image deployed with clusters is now the [minimal base image](https://gallery.ecr.aws/eks-distro-build-tooling/eks-distro-minimal-base-iptables) maintained by Amazon EKS Distro \(EKS\-D\)\. The image contains minimal packages and doesn't have shells or package managers\.
+ Kubernetes graduated ephemeral containers to beta\. Ephemeral containers are temporary containers that run in the same namespace as an existing Pod\. You can use them to observe the state of Pods and containers for troubleshooting and debugging purposes\. This is especially useful for interactive troubleshooting when `kubectl exec` is insufficient because either a container has crashed or a container image doesn't include debugging utilities\. An example of a container that includes a debugging utility is [distroless images](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless#distroless-container-images)\. For more information, see [Debugging with an ephemeral debug container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/debug-running-pod/#ephemeral-container) in the Kubernetes documentation\.
+ Kubernetes graduated the `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` `autoscaling/v2` stable API to general availability\. The `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` `autoscaling/v2beta2` API is deprecated\. It will be unavailable in `1.26`\.
+ The [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) option in the Kubernetes API server helps prevent `HTTP/2` client connections from being stuck on a single API server instance, by randomly closing a connection\. When the connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect, and will likely land on a different API server as a result of load balancing\. Amazon EKS version `1.23` has enabled `goaway-chance` flag\. If your workload running on Amazon EKS cluster uses a client that is not compatible with [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8), we recommend that you update your client to handle `GOAWAY` by reconnecting on connection termination\.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.23` changelog, see [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v1220](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v1220)\.

## Amazon EKS version support and FAQ<a name="version-deprecation"></a>

In line with the Kubernetes community support for Kubernetes versions, Amazon EKS is committed to supporting at least four production\-ready versions of Kubernetes at any given time\. We will announce the end of support date of a given Kubernetes minor version at least 60 days before the end of support date\. Because of the Amazon EKS qualification and release process for new Kubernetes versions, the end of support date of a Kubernetes version on Amazon EKS will be on or after the date that the Kubernetes project stops supporting the version upstream\.

### Frequently asked questions<a name="deprecation-faq"></a>

**Q: How long is a Kubernetes version supported by Amazon EKS?**  
A: A Kubernetes version is supported for 14 months after first being available on Amazon EKS\. This is true even if upstream Kubernetes no longer support a version that's available on Amazon EKS\. We backport security patches that are applicable to the Kubernetes versions that are supported on Amazon EKS\.

**Q: Am I notified when support is ending for a Kubernetes version on Amazon EKS?**  
A: Yes\. If any clusters in your account are running the version nearing the end of support, Amazon EKS sends out a notice through the AWS Health Dashboard approximately 12 months after the Kubernetes version was released on Amazon EKS\. The notice includes the end of support date\. This is at least 60 days from the date of the notice\.

**Q: What happens on the end of support date?**  
A: On the end of support date, you can no longer create new Amazon EKS clusters with the unsupported version\. Existing control planes are automatically updated by Amazon EKS to the earliest supported version through a gradual deployment process after the end of support date\. After the automatic control plane update, make sure to manually update cluster add\-ons and Amazon EC2 nodes\. For more information, see [Update the Kubernetes version for your Amazon EKS cluster ](update-cluster.md#update-existing-cluster)\.

**Q: When exactly is my control plane automatically updated after the end of support date?**  
A: Amazon EKS can't provide specific time frames\. Automatic updates can happen at any time after the end of support date\. You won't receive any notification before the update\. We recommend that you proactively update your control plane without relying on the Amazon EKS automatic update process\. For more information, see [Updating an Amazon EKS cluster Kubernetes version](update-cluster.md)\.

**Q: Can I leave my control plane on a Kubernetes version indefinitely?**  
A: No\. Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority\. Past a certain point \(usually one year\), the Kubernetes community stops releasing common vulnerabilities and exposures \(CVE\) patches and discourages CVE submission for unsupported versions\. This means that vulnerabilities specific to an older version of Kubernetes might not even be reported\. This leaves clusters exposed with no notice and no remediation options in the event of a vulnerability\. Given this, Amazon EKS doesn't allow control planes to stay on a version that reached end of support\.

**Q: Which Kubernetes features are supported by Amazon EKS?**  
A: Amazon EKS supports all general availability features of the Kubernetes API\. It also supports all beta features, which are enabled by default\. Alpha features aren't supported\.

**Q: Are Amazon EKS managed node groups automatically updated along with the cluster control plane version?**  
A: No\. A managed node group creates Amazon EC2 instances in your account\. These instances aren't automatically upgraded when you or Amazon EKS update your control plane\. Assume that Amazon EKS automatically updates your control plane\. The Kubernetes version that's on your managed node group might be more than one version earlier than your control plane\. Then, assume that a managed node group contains instances that are running a version of Kubernetes that's more than one version earlier than the control plane\. The node group has a health issue in the **Node groups** section of the **Compute** tab of your cluster in the console\. Last, if a node group has an available version update, **Update now** appears next to the node group in the console\. For more information, see [Updating a managed node group](update-managed-node-group.md)\. We recommend maintaining the same Kubernetes version on your control plane and nodes\.

**Q: Are self\-managed node groups automatically updated along with the cluster control plane version?**  
A: No\. A self\-managed node group includes Amazon EC2 instances in your account\. These instances aren't automatically upgraded when you or Amazon EKS update the control plane version on your behalf\. A self\-managed node group doesn't have any indication in the console that it needs updating\. You can view the `kubelet` version installed on a node by selecting the node in the **Nodes** list on the **Overview** tab of your cluster to determine which nodes need updating\. You must manually update the nodes\. For more information, see [Self\-managed node updates](update-workers.md)\.

The Kubernetes project tests compatibility between the control plane and nodes for up to two minor versions\. For example, `1.25` nodes continue to operate when orchestrated by a `1.27` control plane\. However, running a cluster with nodes that are persistently two minor versions behind the control plane isn't recommended\. For more information, see [Kubernetes version and version skew support policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/version-skew-policy/) in the Kubernetes documentation\. We recommend maintaining the same Kubernetes version on your control plane and nodes\.

**Q: Are Pods running on Fargate automatically upgraded with an automatic cluster control plane version upgrade?**  
A: No\. We strongly recommend running Fargate Pods as part of a replication controller, such as a Kubernetes deployment\. Then do a rolling restart of all Fargate Pods\. The new version of the Fargate Pod is deployed with a `kubelet` version that's the same version as your updated cluster control plane version\. For more information, see [Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment) in the Kubernetes documentation\.

**Important**  
If you update the control plane, you must still update the Fargate nodes yourself\. To update Fargate nodes, delete the Fargate Pod represented by the node and redeploy the Pod\. The new Pod is deployed with a `kubelet` version that's the same version as your cluster\.
